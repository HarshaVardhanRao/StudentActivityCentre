## üîß **Changes Made**

### **1. Enhanced Event Model**
```python

    # ... existing fields ...
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, 
                                   related_name='created_events', help_text='User who created this event')
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=EventStatus.choices, default=EventStatus.PENDING)
    approval_notes = models.TextField(blank=True, help_text='Notes from administrators during approval process')
    # ... other fields ...
```

**New Status Flow:**

# Faculty advisors can create events for clubs they advise
if 'FACULTY' in (request.user.roles or []) or 'CLUB_ADVISOR' in (request.user.roles or []):
    user_clubs = request.user.advised_clubs.all()

# Club coordinators can create events for clubs they coordinate  
elif 'CLUB_COORDINATOR' in (request.user.roles or []):
    user_clubs = request.user.coordinated_clubs.all()

# Admins can create events for any club

    user_clubs = Club.objects.all()
```
